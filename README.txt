Programmer: Daniel P. Mullen

Program Summary: This program is a question game where the computer attempts
                 to guess what the user is thinking from eliminating options
                 based on user response to questions. If the computer is
                 defeated it then learns what the user was thinking and a
                 question is added to include that thought in the next game.
